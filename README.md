# A Web app built with Python 3 using Flask and Jinja
## It consisits of a simple dashboard to download an SQL dataset as a CSV on clicking the appropriate link in the web app

1. You can input your own connextion string - works with any Db Flask and Python supports ( I was using Microsoft SQL Server 2012 )
2. The current use case is downloading retail data for a particular store - sales, product lists etc.
